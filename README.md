# Performance-tool

## Overview
The `performance-tool.py` script is designed to analyze and improve the performance of custom themes in web projects. It performs various checks to identify potential issues in theme files, such as missing attributes, non-optimized images, and inline styles/scripts.

## Features
The tool performs the following checks:
1. **Libraries.yml (Async/Defer)**: Ensures JavaScript files in `libraries.yml` have `async` or `defer` attributes.
2. **Non-Optimized Images (CSS & Twig)**: Detects non-WebP image formats in CSS and Twig files.
3. **Inline CSS/JS in Twig**: Flags excessive inline `<style>` and `<script>` tags in Twig templates.
4. **Large Images in CSS/Twig**: Checks for images larger than 500 KB in CSS and Twig files.
5. **Missing Async/Defer in `<script>`**: Ensures inline `<script>` tags in Twig files have `async` or `defer` attributes.
